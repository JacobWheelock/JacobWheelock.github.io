EZ-FRCNN is an <a href="https://github.com/JacobWheelock/FRCNN2">open source</a>, highly accessible software package for object detection tasks in 
ethology and cell biology. Using the FRCNN neural network architecture, the package allows users
to quickly annotate images or frames from videos, fine-tune pretrained models for custom datasets,
and use these models to detect objects in novel images or videos.
